Purpose of this project.
After a lot of successful web projects, I found myself writing almost same code over and over again. Sometimes, I copied codes I wrote before, and sometimes I had to create a new one. Even though there are a lot of websites which share web designs, I decided to create one to share layouts. I try to focus more on layout rather than anything else. So, you may find some high quality images used as thumbnails. Obviously, it's the bad practice, and it's only for demo purposes.

How this project can help you?
These layouts are basic layouts you will be using in most of your web projects. I try not to add any designs other than basic CSS, so that you can add them to fit your needs and style.

How can you contribute to this project?
Pull the code from github or download as a zipped file. Create new unique layout and commit your codes or send them as an attachment to contact@sherzod.me. I will check the code for a valid HTML and CSS, and will post it on github. Or at least send me your PSD file or some kind of sketch of the layout you would like to see in this project, and I will try my best to create one.

Why Twitter Bootstrap?
As you can see, I chose to use Twitter Bootstrap as a main library for creating layouts, and there are a lot of good reasons for it. First of all, it's fast to create layouts and it's easy to understand the code. It has nice pre-built CSS and couple JS Libraries, which are very helpful. For a full info about Twitter Bootstrap, refer to its github page.
